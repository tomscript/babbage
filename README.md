Babbage is a simple and extensible open source tool for manipulating data.

_Currently migrating to a more modern stack. Take a look at [early progress](https://frontend-dot-babbage-stable.appspot)._

Few TODOs that need to be finished:

- Downloading a file.
- Uploading a file.
- Build instructions for the cli.
- Improve documentation for running your own instance.
