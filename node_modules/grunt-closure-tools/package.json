Find the latest compiler.jar file [here](http://dl.google.com/closure-compiler/compiler-latest.zip).\n  2. **`src`** The js files you want to compile.\n\nYou can fully configure how the compiler will behave, by setting directives in the `options`. Every key will be used as a directive for the compiler.\n\nYou can use grunt file syntax (`<config:...>` or `path/**/*.js`) for the `js` directive and for declaring externs, set in `options.externs`.\n\nRead more about the closure compiler [here](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/api-tutorial3).\n\n#### Sample Config for The Closure Compiler\n```javascript\nclosureCompiler:  {\n\n  options: {\n    // [REQUIRED] Path to closure compiler\n    compilerFile: 'path/to/closure/compiler.jar',\n\n    // [OPTIONAL] set to true if you want to check if files were modified\n    // before starting compilation (can save some time in large sourcebases)\n    checkModified: true,\n\n    // [OPTIONAL] Set Closure Compiler Directives here\n    compilerOpts: {\n      /**\n       * Keys will be used as directives for the compiler\n       * values can be strings or arrays.\n       * If no value is required use null\n       *\n       * The directive 'externs' is treated as a special case\n       * allowing a grunt file syntax (<config:...>, *)\n       *\n       * Following are some directive samples...\n       */\n       compilation_level: 'ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS',\n       externs: ['path/to/file.js', '/source/**/*.js'],\n       define: [\"'goog.DEBUG=false'\"],\n       warning_level: 'verbose',\n       jscomp_off: ['checkTypes', 'fileoverviewTags'],\n       summary_detail_level: 3,\n       output_wrapper: '\"(function(){%output%}).call(this);\"'\n    },\n    // [OPTIONAL] Set exec method options\n    execOpts: {\n       /**\n        * Set maxBuffer if you got message \"Error: maxBuffer exceeded.\"\n        * Node default: 200*1024\n        */\n       maxBuffer: 999999 * 1024\n    },\n    // [OPTIONAL] Java VM optimization options\n    // see https://code.google.com/p/closure-compiler/wiki/FAQ#What_are_the_recommended_Java_VM_command-line_options?\n    // Setting one of these to 'true' is strongly recommended,\n    // and can reduce compile times by 50-80% depending on compilation size\n    // and hardware.\n    // On server-class hardware, such as with Github's Travis hook,\n    // TieredCompilation should be used; on standard developer hardware,\n    // d32 may be better. Set as appropriate for your environment.\n    // Default for both is 'false'; do not set both to 'true'.\n    d32: true, // will use 'java -client -d32 -jar compiler.jar'\n    TieredCompilation: true // will use 'java -server -XX:+TieredCompilation -jar compiler.jar'\n  },\n\n  // any name that describes your task\n  targetName: {\n\n    /**\n     *[OPTIONAL] Here you can add new or override previous option of the Closure Compiler Directives.\n     * IMPORTANT! The feature is enabled as a temporary solution to [#738](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues/738).\n     * As soon as issue will be fixed this feature will be removed.\n     */\n    TEMPcompilerOpts: {\n    }\n\n    // [OPTIONAL] Target files to compile. Can be a string, an array of strings\n    // or grunt file syntax (<config:...>, *)\n    src: 'path/to/file.js',\n\n    // [OPTIONAL] set an output file\n    dest: 'path/to/compiled_file.js'\n  }\n}\n```\nClosure compiler is typically used to produce a single output file out of multiple input files. For such scenario you specify `src` and `dest` properties as in the sample above.\nGrunt, however, has richer support for specifying **[source-destination mappings](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks#files)** and you can leverage it for accomplishing\nother compilation scenarios, e.g. compiling a single output file out of each source file as demonstrates the sample below. To support also generation of source maps for this case\nyou can specify `create_source_map` in **compilerOpts** with value set to `null`. This causes passing the `dest` filename with suffix `.map` to closure compiler's `create_source_map` parameter\n(this behavior is valid only when source-destination file mapping is specified for processing).\n```javascript\nclosureCompiler: {\n    options: {\n\t\t// most options here omitted for brevity\n\n\t\tcompilerOpts: {\n\t\t\t// most options here omitted for brevity\n\n\t\t\tcreate_source_map: null,\n\n\t\t\t/**\n\t\t\t * When 'create_source_map' with value set to null is defined here AND the dest file is specified in\n\t\t\t * the form of source-destination file mapping, the name of dest file extended with '.map' is passed\n\t\t\t * as value of parameter 'create_source_map' to the compiler to enable a source map file per output file.\n\t\t\t * E.g. for\n\t\t\t *\t files: [\n\t\t\t *\t\t{src: 'lib/a.js', dest: 'build/a.min.js'},\n\t\t\t *\t\t{src: 'lib/b.js', dest: 'build/b.min.js'},\n\t\t\t *\t  ],\n\t\t\t * the value of 'create_source_map' would be 'build/a.min.js.map' for the first mapping\n\t\t\t * and 'build/b.min.js.map' for the second one.\n\t\t\t */\n\t\t}\n\t},\n\tminify: {\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * Following sample uses dynamically created mappings, where src array of globs is evaluated\n\t\t * and dest file is constructed for each source file by replacing its extension with '.min.js'.\n\t\t */\n\t\tfiles: [\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\texpand: true,\n\t\t\t\tsrc: ['**/*.js', '!**/*.min.js'],\n\t\t\t\text: '.min.js'\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t]\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Closure Builder\n\nThe Closure Builder task has 3 required directives:\n\n  1. A way to find the `closurebuilder.py` file. One of the following two directives are required:\n    * **`closureLibraryPath`** A path to the Google Closure Library. From there we can infer the location of the closurebuilder.py file\n    * **`builder`** Directly reference the closurebuilder.py file\n  2. An input method must be defined. One of the following two directives is required:\n    * **`inputs`** String, array or grunt file syntax to define build targets\n    * **`namespaces`** String or array to define namespaces to build\n  3. The root targets of the closureBuilder. These are defined in the:\n    * **`src`** option of each target. Can be string or array.\n\nThe builder has the ability to compile *on-the-fly* the built files. To enable this option you need to set the option `compile` to boolean `true` and then set the location of the `compiler.jar` file via the `compiler` directive.\n\nYou can set all the compiler directives in the `compiler_options` object. The `js` directive is no longer required, as the builder takes care of that. The compiler directives follow the same logic as the ones in the Closure Compiler multitask described above.\n\nRead more about the closure builder in [this link](https://developers.google.com/closure/library/docs/closurebuilder).\n\n#### Sample Config for The Closure Builder\n\n```javascript\nclosureBuilder:  {\n  options: {\n    // [REQUIRED] To find the builder executable we need either the path to\n    //    closure library or directly the filepath to the builder:\n    closureLibraryPath: 'path/to/closure-library', // path to closure library\n    // [OPTIONAL] You can define an alternative path of the builder.\n    //    If set it trumps 'closureLibraryPath' which will not be required.\n    builder: 'path/to/closurebuilder.py',\n\n    // [REQUIRED] One of the two following options is required:\n    inputs: 'string|Array', // input files (can just be the entry point)\n    namespaces: 'string|Array', // namespaces\n\n    // [OPTIONAL] The location of the compiler.jar\n    // This is required if you set the option \"compile\" to true.\n    compilerFile: 'path/to/compiler.jar',\n\n    // [OPTIONAL] output_mode can be 'list', 'script' or 'compiled'.\n    //    If compile is set to true, 'compiled' mode is enforced.\n    //    Default is 'script'.\n    output_mode: '',\n\n    // [OPTIONAL] if we want builder to perform compile\n    compile: false, // boolean\n\n    compilerOpts: {\n      /**\n      * Go wild here...\n      * any key will be used as an option for the compiler\n      * value can be a string or an array\n      * If no value is required use null\n      */\n    },\n    // [OPTIONAL] Set exec method options\n    execOpts: {\n       /**\n        * Set maxBuffer if you got message \"Error: maxBuffer exceeded.\"\n        * Node default: 200*1024\n        */\n       maxBuffer: 999999 * 1024\n    }\n\n  },\n\n  // any name that describes your operation\n  targetName: {\n\n    // [REQUIRED] paths to be traversed to build the dependencies\n    src: 'string|Array',\n\n    // [OPTIONAL] if not set, will output to stdout\n    dest: ''\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Closure DepsWriter\n\nThe Closure DepsWriter task has 1 required directive:\n\n  1. A way to find the `depswriter.py` file. One of the following two directives is required:\n    * **`closureLibraryPath`** A path to the Google Closure Library. From there we can infer the location of the depswriter.py file\n    * **`depswriter`** Directly reference the depswriter.py file\n\nRead more about depswriter [here](https://developers.google.com/closure/library/docs/depswriter).\n\n#### Sample Config for The Closure DepsWriter\n\n```javascript\nclosureDepsWriter: {\n  options: {\n    // [REQUIRED] To find the depswriter executable we need either the path to\n    //    closure library or the depswriter executable full path:\n    closureLibraryPath: 'path/to/closure-library',\n\n    // [OPTIONAL] Define the full path to the executable directly.\n    //    If set it trumps 'closureLibraryPath' which will not be required.\n    depswriter: 'path/to/depswriter.py', // filepath to depswriter\n\n    // [OPTIONAL] Root directory to scan. Can be string or array\n    root: ['source/ss', 'source/closure-library', 'source/showcase'],\n\n    // [OPTIONAL] Root with prefix takes a pair of strings separated with a space,\n    //    so proper way to use it is to suround with quotes.\n    //    can be a string or array\n    root_with_prefix: '\"source/ss ../../ss\"',\n\n    // [OPTIONAL] string or array\n    path_with_depspath: ''\n\n\n  },\n   // any name that describes your operation\n  targetName: {\n\n    // [OPTIONAL] Set file targets. Can be a string, array or\n    //    grunt file syntax (<config:...> or *)\n    src: 'path/to/awesome.js',\n\n    // [OPTIONAL] If not set, will output to stdout\n    dest: ''\n\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Release History\n\n- **v0.9.6**, *12 Mar 2014*\n  - Added test suite\n  - Support for ClosureBuilder new JVM flags Thanks [@robertdimarco](https://github.com/robertdimarco)\n- **v0.9.4**, *07 Mar 2014*\n  - Properly escapes compiler filename, will fix cases where spaces existed in the filename.
